# Store Inventory Manager #

## Project Description ##

This application is designed for use by a retail store employee to record incoming orders of different products. The logic and data are managed in a RESTful HTTP service, while the user interface is a console application. The user can examine customer information, searchable by name, and examine the sortable order history, including orders to specific locations and by specific customers. Orders are validated and store inventory is tracked as orders are fulfilled or rejected.
